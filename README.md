Quantum dimensionality reduction study investigates the effectiveness of quantum dimensionality reduction (qDR) techniques in enhancing data analysis and feature learning compared to classical methods. We explore various qDR methods, including Quantum Principal Component Analysis (qPCA), Quantum Linear Discriminant Analysis (qLDA), Quantum Gaussian Distribution Adaptation (qGDA), and Quantum t-SNE (qt-SNE), applied to diverse datasets such as Iris, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Olivetti Faces. The performance of these techniques is assessed through comparative analysis with classical methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Gaussian Distribution Adaptation (GDA), using metrics such as loss, fidelity, and processing time. Our results reveal that PCA performs exceptionally well on the Iris dataset, demonstrating the lowest loss and highest fidelity. In contrast, t-SNE shows moderate performance on the Digits dataset, while UMAP performs satisfactorily on the Wine dataset with robust fidelity. Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) exhibit variable performance across different datasets, with LLE showing the highest loss and lowest fidelity on the Olivetti Faces dataset. Hypothesis testing indicates that qDR techniques do not significantly outperform their classical counterparts in preserving relevant information from quantum datasets. Specifically, paired t-tests reveal no substantial differences between classical PCA and qPCA, LDA and qLDA, or GDA and qGDA, in terms of capturing intricate patterns. Mutual information and clustering accuracy analyses suggest that qPCA might offer superior pattern recognition compared to standardized PCA, but qLDA and qGDA do not demonstrate significant advantages over classical methods. The research highlights the need for robust qDR methods capable of operating effectively within these constraints and suggests future directions for reducing noise, developing scalable techniques, and integrating quantum-classical approaches. This study underscores the potential of qDR techniques to transform data analysis by providing deeper insights into high-dimensional quantum datasets, despite the current limitations in computational resources and hardware efficiency.
